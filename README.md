# AIDEPluginGenerator
DroidScript Plugin Template Generator for AIDE + Has the function of assembling a compiled plugin from AIDE, in one click you can assemble it into *.ppk and install it in DroidScript.

Actually, I didn't develop it. I just added the ability to run it on android 10+

Due to droidscript problems with SAF, I posted an apk with a modified js, manifest file.
